known_limitations:
  - issue: simulation_view assumes a matching template exists for every experiment slug.
    location: experiments/views.py
    impact: Missing template can cause server error when rendering simulation page.
  - issue: No explicit API or form validation layer for user inputs because endpoints are page-rendering only.
    location: experiments/views.py
    impact: Limited automated validation coverage and no JSON API contract.
